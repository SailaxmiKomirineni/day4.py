1. Variable names and convention. Things to consider in declaring a variable?
2. What is (strings method) immutable and mutable. Advantages of immutable and mutable. Why to use them?
3. What is list?
4. What is heterogeneous datatype and homogeneous datatype and it uses in list?
5. what are list methods?

1. => variable is a container for storing values. 
   => It should only starts with underscore or alphabet not numbers or characters.
   => If it start with number it gives syntax error: invalid decimal literal and 
   =>if you use character syntax error: invalid syntax.
   declaring a variable should depends on type of values or operations done in values.

2. =>Immutable : the thing which is unchangable is called immutable
     mutable   : the thing which is changable is called mutable
   =>Advantages :
     Immutables are designed to face the deadlock situations (when two person tried to access same object at same time) (then access 
     denied for both. immutable data type provide security for data in it, by not changing the value.
     ex : milk mixed with water, cake
     Mutable : changing data frequently.
     ex :  items in refridgerator can be replacable.

3. => heterogeneous datatype : different datatype are used in single collection.ex:-list
   => homogeneous datatype   : same datatype are used in single collection.ex:-array

4. =>list in python : list is a collection of values which can contains heterogeneous data type and can modify the values.
   =>array in python : array is a data structures used to store collection of same data type(homogeneous data type).

5. => Methods of list and array:
   * append(): add values at the end of list.
   * pop()   : remove last value of list if pop() is empty, else removing the specified index value.
   * insert(): add values in list.
   * remove(): removing the specified value.
   * index() : To find index of particular number
   * count() : To find count of particular number specified in count()
   * extend(): concatenates to lists.
   * reverse(): reverse the order of a list.
   * sort()   : sort's a list.
